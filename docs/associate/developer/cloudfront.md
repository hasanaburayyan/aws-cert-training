# CloudFront

## Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- A system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and a content deliver server
- Basically speeds up delivery of web content
- Content Delivery vs. Transfer Acceleration
  - CDN focus on download
  - Transfer Acceleration is upload
- Scenario
  - Website in UK
  - Users in America, South America, South Africa, Austrailia, India
    - Users further from UK can experience greater latency and less responsiveness
  - We use edge locations to keep copy of website in edge locations which are much closer to users.
    - First time user requests resource edge location makes request to server in UK and downloads the resource
    - resource is then cached so that subsequent requests for that item will be served to user from edge location
    - cache is temporary and will be cleared after a time period
    - cache can be cleared manually but there will be a fee to do so
      - This may be done if you need users to be given most recent updates
- Key Terminology
  - Edge Location
    - Location where content is cached and can also be written (Not a region or AZ)
    - More edge locations than AZs or Regions (edge locations > AZs > Regions)
  - Origin
    - The origin of all the files that the CDN will be distributing
    - Can be S3 Bucket, EC2 Instance, Elastic Load Balancer, or Route53

    - The name given to CDN which consist of collection of edge locations
