# EC2

- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- Secure, resizable compute capacity in the Cloud
- Basically VM hosted in AWS
- Designed to make web scale cloud computing easier
- Capacity when you need it and complete control
- History:
  - Game Changer when it was introduced.
  - Pay only what you use
  - No Wasted Capacity (Grow and Shrink when needed)
  - Prior to EC2 (Capacity Estimates, Long term investment, 3-5 years)
- Servers Running in Minutes NOT Months.
- Pricing Models:
  - On Demand (Pay For Time Running)
    - Flexible
    - Short-Term
    - Testing The Water.
  - Reserved Instances (Reserve capacity for 1-3 years BIG discount. Up to 72%)
    - Predictable Usage (steady state)
    - Specific Capacity Requirements
    - Pay Up-Front
    - Standard RIs (Claim 72% off)
      - Cannot Change Instance Size Later
    - Convertible RIs
      - Up to 54% off.
      - Option to convert to other instance type of equal or greater value
    - Scheduled RIs
      - Launch within time window you define
        - Match capacity reservation time frame
        - Use RIs during your busy time
  - Spot (Purchase unused capacity at discount of 90% Prices. Process can be interrupted)
    - Applications that have flexible start and end times
    - Applications that are feasible at very low compute prices
    - Users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity
  - Dedicated (Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Good for software license restriction. Also most expensive)
    - Application with Compliance requirement that does not support multi-tenant virtualization
    - Purchase Plans:
      - On-Demand
      - Reserved
  - Saving Plans:
    - Save up to 72% when paying for All AWS Compute usage, regardless of instance type or Region
    - Commit To One or Three Years
    - Super Flexible (Not only for EC2)
- EC2 Instance Types:
  - Stats of Instance Type
    - Hardware
    - Capabilities
      - CPU
      - Memory
      - Storage
  - Instance Types are optimized to fit different use cases
