# S3

- Simple Storage Service (S3)
  - Give devs and IT team secure, durable, scalable object storage
    - Not for OS and database
    - Data spread across multiple devices and facilities so these are HA
  - Object based
    - Objects can be 0 Bytest to 5 TB
  - Larges size file that can transfer to S3 using PUT is 5 GB
  - Unlimited Storage
  - Files are stored in Buckets (similar to folder)
  - S3 is a universal namespace (means they are a global service)
  - When upload is successful you recieve a HTTP 200 status code
- Data consitency
  - Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
    - Means that as soon as file is uploaded it is available to read
  - Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
    - Means can take some time for changes to propegate
- S3 Under Hood
  - S3 is object based and objects conists of the following
    - Key (This is the name of an object)
    - Value (This is the data, sequence of bytes)
    - Version ID (Allows for versioning and rolling back)
    - Metadata (Data about the data)
    - Subresources - Bucket specfic configurations
      - Bucket Policies, access control lists
      - Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
    - Transfer Acceleration
      - Allows for increase transfer speed

## The Basics

- Built for 99.99% availability for S3 platform
- Amazon Gurantees 99.9% availability
- Amazon Gurantees 99.999999999% (the 11 9's) durability for S3 information
  - This means they expect you to lose 1 file ever 10,000 years
- Tiered Storage Available
- Lifecycle Management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure data access with Access Control lists

## Storage Tiers/Classes

### S3 (standard)

- 99.99% availability
- 11 9s durability
- Redundancy exists across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently

### S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed)

- Data that is access less frequently but requires rapid access when needed
- Lower fee than S3 but chared with access data

### S3 One Zone IA

- Same as IA however data is stored in a single AZ
- Still contains 11 9s durability
- Only 99.5% availability
- Cost 20% less than regular S3 IA

### S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage

- Designed with only 99.99% durability
- 99.99% Availability
- Meant for data that is easily recreatable is lost
- Not offered in some regions
- AWS recommends NOT using this class
  - Recommended to use S3 standard
  - S3 standard price was reduce to be lower than this to help move people off

### S3 Glacier

- Designed for Data that is infrequently accessed
- Very Cheap
- Takes 3-5 hours to retrieve data

### S3 Deep Archive Glacier

- Glacier but more infrequent
- 12 hour retrieval time

### S3 Intelligent Tiering

- Designed for data with unknown or unpredictable access patterns
- 2 tiers
  - frequent
  - infrequent
- Objects are automatically moved around between tiers depending on access patterns
- 11 9s durability
- 99.99% accessibility
- Small Monthly fee for monitoring/automation

## Charges

- Storage per GB
- Requests (GET, PUT, COPY, ect)
- Storage Mangement Pricing
  - Inventory, Analytics, Object Tags
- Data Management Pricing
  - Free transfer in
  - Charge for transfer in
- Transfer Acceleration
  - Use of CloudFront to optimize speed

## S3 ACLs & Policies

## Access Control List ACL

- Per file/object basis
  - By default only access to owner of file
- Fine grain access control

## Bucket Policies

- Documents that govern what settings for a given resource
- JSON objects
- Can use policy generator so you dont have to write JSON
  - Will generate JSON code that you can copy and paste into policy editor
  - Sometimes the policy generator will need to have a wildcard operator added to the resource

## S3 Encryption

- Encryption
  - In Transit (Encrypt data being sent to and from bucket)
    - Done with SSL/TLS
  - At Rest (Encrypt data that is in bucket)
    - Server Side Encryption
      - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
        - Amazon does everything
          - Encrypts data
          - Encrypts Keys
      - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys, SSE-KMS
        - Get a seperate key called "Envelope Key"
          - This is key that encrypts the key
          - Get Audit trail to see when and who has used encryption key
          - Can use your own key
      - Server side Encryption with customer Provided Key
        - AWS manages encryption and decryption
        - User manages their own keys
    - Client Side Encryption
      - User encrypts files themselves before uploading files into S3
- Enforcing Encryption
  - Every upload sends a PUT request
  - Request header contains information for S3 to understand what needs to be done
  - x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter included in request header if file needs encrypted at upload time
    - Two options available
      - x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256 (SSE-S3 - S3 managed keys)
      - x-amz-server-side-encryption: ams:kms (SSE-KMS - KMS managed keys)
  - In order to enforce encryption all we need to do is make a bucket policy that denies any S3 PUT requests which do not include the x-amz-server-side-encryption
  - How to enable
    - Can be done via the the console (which is the easy way)
    - Can be done with an S3 Bucket Policy (Written in JSON)

## Cross-Access-Resource-Sharing (CORS)

- Allows access from one resource (bucket) to another
- If you open to all you leave your resources exposed and vulnerable to attack

## S3 Perfomance Optimization

- (This has been deprecated advice since AWS increased S3 performance in 2018)
- By default S3 is designed to handle very high request rates
  - If you are recieving over 100 PUT/LIST or 300 DELETE per second then you need to optimize
  - This was changed in 2018 to 3500 put requests per second and 5500 get requests
- Mixed Request Type Workloads
  - A mix of GET, PUT, DELETE, LIST
- Optimize by NOT using sequential keys as part of the file names
  - Random over sequential
- This spreads the I/O on different partitions which spreads the I/O
