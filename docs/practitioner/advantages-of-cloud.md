# Six Advantages Of Cloud Computing

1. Trade Capital Expense for variable expense
Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you use them you can pay for how much you are gonna use. 

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
you will never have the same purchasing power as Amazon.

3. Stop guessing about capacity
don't buy too much or too little.

4. Increase speed and agility
A cloud Guru platform was built in 3 weeks, using a new type of design called serverless architecture. It scales infinitely with demand. 

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

6. Go global in minutes

## Infrastructure As A Service

You manage the server which can be physical or virtual. As well as operating system, usually the data center provider will have no access to your server

## Platform As A Service

Someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems. You focus on applications, someone else worries about security patching, updates, maintenance etc.

## Software As A Service

Think of Gmail. All you do is manage your inbox and google handles everything else.

## Cloud Computing Deployment Types

- Public Cloud
- AWS, Azure, GCP
- Hybrid
- Mixture of public and private
- Private Cloud (On Premise)
- you host and manage it in your datacenters

### AWS - High Level Services Of Note*

- AWS Global Infrastructure
- AWS Cost Management
- Compute
- Databases
- Migration & Transfer
- Network & Content Delivery
- Security, Identity, & Compliance
- Storage

## CAPEX vs. OPEX

Capex:

- Stands for Capital expenditure which is where you pay upfront and it is a fixed sunk in cost.

Opex
- Operational Expenditure which is where you pay for what you use.
- Think about it like utilities (gas, electric)

## Pricing Policies

- Pay as you go
- Pay less when you reserve
- Pay even less per unit when using more
- Pay even less as AWS gross
- Custom pricing

## Fundamental Drivers Of Cost With AWS
