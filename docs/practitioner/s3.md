# What is S3

## Simple Service Storage (S3)

- one of the oldest services
- Provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve

- S3 is safe place to store files
- Object-based storage
- Block based storage would be for operating systems (NOT s3)

- Files can be from 0bytes to 5 TB

- Unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets (Folders in cloud)

- S3 is a universal Namespace so name must be unique GLOBALLY

- Version ID
- Metadata
- Subresources
  - Access Control Lists
  - Torrent

### S3 NEED TO KNOW Exam Tips

- How does consistency work for S3 
  - Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
  - Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)

- If writing file, put a file into S3 you can immediately read that data.

- If you update existing file or delete file you may get an older version. Basically changes can take some time to propagate to S3

- S3 has following guarantees
- 99.99% availability for S3 platform But amazon only Gurantees 99.9% availability
- AMAZON does guarantee 99.999999999% durability (the 11 9's) So very unlikely to lose File
- To Calculate: Number of seconds in any given months and multiply it by 99.99%

- S3 - One Zone - IA
- S3 - Intelligent Tiering (using machine learning to determine what you need)
- S3 - Glacier (secure, durable low cost data archiving)

- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management pricing
- Data Transfer pricing
- Transfer Acceleration

enables fast and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and s3 buckets.
(Users upload to edge sites then use Amazon intranet to upload)

## Restricting ACCESS in S3

1. Use Bucket Policies - Applies across the whole bucket
2. Object Policies - Applies to individual files
3. IAM Policies to Users and Groups - applies to users and groups

Static Websites can be hosted in S3 Buckets
Dynamic Websites CANNOT be hosted in S3 Buckets
S3 buckets scale dynamically
